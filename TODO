Gnucap-Icarus cosimulation plugin
ToDo list:


1. Get rid of method EVAL_BM_EXTPWL::voltage()
instead of using this method, gnucap measurement shall be used (as far as  
understanded now). Consequently - remove all what si related to ::voltage().

2. Make EVAL_BM_EXTPWL derived from EVAL_BM_PWL

3. make more usage examples

4. Minor fixes:
  o Move to gnucap-2009-10-11
  o complete GNU BUILD (.so lib is not build yet using GNU Build system)
  + fix KevinC's changes in Makefiles

5. Icarus/Verilog is modified. 
   Make that changes "movable" to icarus/verilog upstream
